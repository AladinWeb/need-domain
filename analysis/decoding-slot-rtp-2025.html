            <h2>The Basics of Slot RTP</h2>
            <p>RTP, or Return to Player, represents the percentage of wagered money a slot machine returns over time. A 97% RTP, for instance, means $97 returned per $100 bet, on average, over countless spins. It’s a theoretical measure, not a promise of instant wins, but it’s a solid starting point for choosing games.</p>
            <h2>RTP’s Impact on Your Strategy</h2>
            <p>In 2025, slots with RTPs above 96% are often recommended for better long-term value. However, RTP works alongside volatility—low-volatility slots pay smaller, frequent wins, while high-volatility ones offer bigger but rarer payouts. Balancing RTP and volatility aligns games with your risk tolerance and goals.</p>
            <h2>Practical Tips for Using RTP</h2>
            <p>Always check a slot’s RTP in its info section or on casino platforms before playing. Resources like <a href="https://legitscasino.ph/guides/understanding-rtp-slots/" target="_blank">LegitsCasino’s slot RTP guide</a> provide detailed breakdowns of popular games. Prioritize slots with transparent RTPs and consider demo modes to test gameplay without financial risk.</p>
            <h2>Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
            <p>A common mistake is over-relying on RTP for short sessions, where luck dominates. Also, RTP excludes bonuses or progressive jackpots, which can significantly alter returns. In 2025, understanding these limits helps you avoid inflated expectations and focus on fun, informed play.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Mastering RTP in 2025 empowers you to choose slots wisely, blending entertainment with strategy. By factoring in RTP and volatility, you can elevate your gaming experience.
