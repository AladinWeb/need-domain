            <h2>Superior Protection for High-Value Vehicles</h2>
            <p>AmeriFreight’s enclosed auto transport shields vehicles from weather, road debris, and potential damage using fully enclosed trailers. Ideal for luxury, classic, or exotic cars, this service ensures pristine delivery. A Miami client shared, “My vintage Porsche arrived spotless thanks to AmeriFreight’s enclosed transport.” Costs typically range from $1,200 to $2,200, about 40-80% more than open transport, but the premium protection is worth it for valuable vehicles.</p>
            <h2>Nationwide Door-to-Door Convenience</h2>
            <p>AmeriFreight provides hassle-free door-to-door service, picking up and delivering vehicles directly to your specified locations. A Los Angeles customer noted, “The driver arrived at my doorstep on time, and my car was delivered without a scratch.” This convenience, combined with their network of over 11,000 vetted carriers, ensures reliable service across the U.S., including Hawaii and Alaska.</p>
            <h2>Comprehensive Gap Protection</h2>
            <p>AmeriFreight’s AFta Plan offers up to $2,000 in gap coverage for deductibles, minor damages, or delays, setting them apart from competitors. A Chicago client said, “The extra coverage gave me peace of mind for my classic Mustang.” This plan, available for $50-$100, allows 48 hours post-delivery to report issues, unlike many competitors’ immediate sign-off policies.</p>
            <h2>Flexible and Transparent Pricing</h2>
            <p>With no upfront payment required until a carrier is secured, AmeriFreight ensures transparency. Their enclosed transport rates vary by distance and vehicle size, with long hauls like California to Texas costing $1,500-$2,200.

A New York reviewer said, “My agent, Katie, was responsive and made the process seamless.” Their team provides updates throughout the transport, ensuring a stress-free experience for clients shipping high-value vehicles.</p>
